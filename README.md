## Overview
The challenge requires a little knowledge of JS and DOM and the rest was pretty easy. The style-guide don't have some colors that were used in the design we were meant to follow, so I just used whatever color was available in the style-guide. 
I hope you'll find this solution helpful! 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating
